A Bayesian approach to inference is very attractive in this context, especially when a meta-analysis is based only on few studies. The bayesmeta R package provides readily accessible tools to perform Bayesian meta-analyses and generate plots and summaries, without having to worry about computational details. It allows for flexible prior specification and instant access to the resulting posterior distributions, including prediction and shrinkage estimation, and facilitating for example quick sensitivity checks. The present paper introduces the underlying theory and showcases its usage.},

	doi = {10.1002/jrsm.1316},
	abstract = {Studies combined in a meta-analysis often have differences in their design and conduct that can lead to heterogeneous results. A random-effects model accounts for these differences in the underlying study effects, which includes a heterogeneity variance parameter. The DerSimonian-Laird method is often used to estimate the heterogeneity variance, but simulation studies have found the method can be biased and other methods are available. This paper compares the properties of nine different heterogeneity variance estimators using simulated meta-analysis data. Simulated scenarios include studies of equal size and of moderate and large differences in size. Results confirm that the DerSimonian-Laird estimator is negatively biased in scenarios with small studies and in scenarios with a rare binary outcome. Results also show the Paule-Mandel method has considerable positive bias in meta-analyses with large differences in study size. We recommend the method of restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate the heterogeneity variance over other methods. However, considering that meta-analyses of health studies typically contain few studies, the heterogeneity variance estimate should not be used as a reliable gauge for the extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis. The estimated summary effect of the meta-analysis and its confidence interval derived from the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method are more robust to changes in the heterogeneity variance estimate and show minimal deviation from the nominal coverage of 95\% under most of our simulated scenarios.},

The analysis recognizes the existence of both within group and between group variabilities, and calculates appropriate weighting factors based on the observed variability for each group. The weighting factors are used to calculate a "best" consensus value from the overall experiment. The technique for obtaining the consensus value is applicable to either the determination of the weighted average value, or to the parameters associated with a weighted least squares regression problem. The calculations are made by using an iterative technique with a truncated Taylor series expansion. The calculations are straightforward, and are easily programmed on a desktop computer. An examination of the observed variabilities, both within groups and between groups, leads to considerable insight into the overall experiment and greatly aids in the design of future experiments.},

Miller (1973) developed a satisfactory asymptotic theory for ML estimators of variance components. There are many iterative algorithms that can be considered for computing the ML or REML estimates. The computations on each iteration of these algorithms are those associated with computing estimates of fixed and random effects for given values of the variance components.},
